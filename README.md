Haute couture looks through your CSS and static HTML to ensure that there are no out-of-date styles. It checks that all class and ID names in the specified CSS file exist in some HTML file. Styles that don't match are output to a file for review by the developer.

If you just want to install the binary to your current directory and don't care about the source code, run

```bash
GOBIN="$(pwd)" GOPATH="$(mktemp -d)" go get github.com/baltimore-sun-data/haute-couture
```
